IV. RECORDING FEATURES AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE

CRITICAL: YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR RECORDING COMPLIANCE

BY USING NOUS MEETING'S RECORDING FEATURES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT
YOU, NOT NOUS MEETING, ARE SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING
WITH ALL APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND INTERNATIONAL RECORDING,
WIRETAPPING, SURVEILLANCE, AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS. NOUS MEETING IS A
TECHNOLOGY SERVICE PROVIDER ONLY AND BEARS ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR
YOUR LEGAL COMPLIANCE OR NON-COMPLIANCE.

A. Nous Meeting's Role as Technology Provider

a) Limited Role: Nous Meeting provides software technology that enables users to
   record, transcribe, and analyze meetings. We act solely as a technology service
   provider and do not provide legal advice, legal compliance services, or legal
   guidance of any kind.

b) No Monitoring or Verification: Nous Meeting does not and cannot monitor whether
   you comply with applicable recording laws, obtain required consents, provide
   adequate notice, or otherwise use recording features lawfully. We do not verify
   participant consent, determine applicable laws for your meetings, or ensure your
   compliance with any legal requirements.

c) Your Acknowledgment: You acknowledge that Nous Meeting makes no
   representations, warranties, or guarantees regarding the legality of recording in
   any jurisdiction or circumstance. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your
   use of recording features complies with all applicable laws.

B. Your Exclusive Responsibility for Legal Compliance

As the user, account holder, meeting host, or person initiating a recording, you are
solely, completely, and exclusively responsible for:

a) Determining all applicable recording, wiretapping, and surveillance laws in all
   jurisdictions where you and your participants are located
b) Understanding whether you are in a one-party consent or all-party consent
   jurisdiction
c) Identifying the location of all meeting participants and determining which laws apply

   recording will occur
e) Obtaining all necessary consents as required by applicable federal, state, local, and
   international laws

   FERPA, etc.)
i) Securing recorded content against unauthorized access or disclosure
j) Implementing appropriate data retention and deletion practices
k) Responding to participant requests regarding access to, correction of, or deletion of
   recordings
l) Accepting all legal, financial, criminal, and civil consequences of any violations of
   recording laws

C. Recording Laws - Your Obligation to Research and Comply

1. U.S. Federal Law

The Electronic Communications Privacy Act or Federal Wiretap Act makes it a federal
crime to intercept or record wire, oral, or electronic communications without the
consent of at least one party. You must ensure compliance with this federal law at a
minimum, but stricter state or international laws may also apply.

2. U.S. State Laws - All-Party Consent States

CRITICAL: The following states require consent from ALL parties before recording:

California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Washington

If you or ANY participant is in one of these states, you MUST obtain explicit consent
from ALL participants before recording. Failure to comply is a criminal offense that
can result in imprisonment, substantial fines, and civil liability. YOU ARE SOLELY
RESPONSIBLE for determining applicable state laws and ensuring compliance.

3. International Laws

If any participant is located outside the United States, you must research and comply
with all applicable international laws, including but not limited to GDPR (EU/EEA),
UK GDPR, PIPEDA (Canada), and other national data protection laws. These laws often
impose stricter requirements than U.S. law. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE for
determining and complying with all international legal requirements.

D. Prohibited Uses of Recording Features

You are strictly prohibited from using recording features to:

a) Record without required legal notice and consent
b) Violate any person's privacy rights or reasonable expectation of privacy
c) Engage in illegal surveillance, wiretapping, stalking, or harassment
d) Record for blackmail, extortion, or other criminal purposes
e) Violate intellectual property rights, confidentiality agreements, or attorney-client
   privilege
f) Record minors without proper parental or guardian consent
g) Create deepfakes or manipulated content from recordings

E. Consequences of Recording Law Violations

WARNING: Violating recording laws can result in severe consequences for which YOU
bear sole responsibility:

a) Criminal prosecution, imprisonment, and substantial fines
b) Civil lawsuits for statutory and actual damages (including treble damages in some
   states)
c) Attorney's fees and court costs
d) Exclusion of recordings as evidence in legal proceedings
e) Professional discipline and employment termination
f) Additional penalties under industry-specific regulations (HIPAA, FERPA, etc.)

F. Account Termination for Recording Violations

Nous Meeting reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts, disable recording
features, delete recordings, and report suspected illegal recording activity to law
enforcement authorities. If we become aware of potential violations of recording laws,
we may take immediate action with or without prior notice. However, any such
enforcement actions do not diminish or eliminate your sole responsibility for legal
compliance.
